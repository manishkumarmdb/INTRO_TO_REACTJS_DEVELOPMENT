# 🚀 Intro to React Apps Development (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This repository is a **React.js practice project** created to learn and strengthen React fundamentals using **Vite + TypeScript**.  
The project consists of multiple small applications demonstrating real-world React concepts such as component-based architecture, props, state management, conditional rendering, API integration, and filtering logic.

Some applications are already implemented, while others are planned and will be added incrementally.

---

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

By exploring this repo, you will:

- Understand the basics of React and component-based architecture
- Learn how to structure a React application
- Use functional components, JSX, and props
- Manage state using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Build, run, and debug a React app locally
- Get hands-on experience with routing and basic UI logic
